-> Python : 35-40 Days (Common for DA/DS/AI or FullStack or Cloud & DevOps)

    -> DA/DS/AI : pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc 
    -> FullStack : Django
    -> Cloud & DevOps : Scripting (OS,SYS,Cloud Modules etc)

-> Python : Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
            with the use of significant indentation. 
            Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

-> Programming Language (Python) : Communicate with Machines

    -> Why shouldn't i Communicate with Machines using English ?

        -> Machines Use Binary Language (01110100101's) 

            -> Binary Language == Machine Language = Low Level Language

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 

                -> python

            // add two numbers
            int sum = first + second;
            System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
        }
    }

    -> Variables Allows you to

        -> Assign Data
        -> Retrieve Data

    -> Syntax:

        variable_name = value 
        student_name = "Ravi"
        = is called as assignment operator

    -> NOTE : A function in python is going to do a task

    -> id() : Is used to display the identity of an object 

    -> type() : Is used to display the type of data assigned for a variable

    -> NOTE : In python a variable can change during the execution

            -> x = 10
            -> x = x + 5 (long form)
            -> x += 5 (short hand) x is now 15
            -> x *= 5 (short hand) x is now 75
        
            -> Increment / Decrement : ++ / -- (python doesn't support this)

        -> Comparison Operators 

            -> Compare Values and Result will be a boolean (True/False)
            -> Used in conditionals

                -> is : return True, if objects are same

                -> is not : return True, if objects are not same

        -> Bitwise Operators

            -> Used in low level programming (0101010)

            -> &(AND) - sets each bit to 1, if both bits are 1
            -> | (OR) - sets each bit to 1, if one of the bits is 1
            -> etc
